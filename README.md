# Password Strength Evaluation

## 📌 Objective
This project aims to understand the characteristics of strong passwords, evaluate different types of passwords using an online tool, and summarize best practices for secure password creation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com) – An online password strength checker

## 🔍 Passwords Tested & Results
| Password       | Score     | Remarks                              |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| `pass123`      | 35%       | Weak – Too short, lacks complexity    |
| `Pass1234`     | 42%       | Fair – No symbols, predictable        |
| `Pa$$1234`     | 94%       | Very Strong – Good mix, short length  |
| `4.T9^g!Qm#z@Lp`| 100%     | Excellent – Long, complex, random     |

## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use **12+ characters**
- Combine **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words**, **names**, or predictable patterns
- **Do not reuse passwords** across different websites
- Use a **password manager**
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible

## ⚠️ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries every possible combination
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses lists of common passwords
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials from other sites
- **Phishing**: Tricks users into giving away passwords

## 🔐 Impact of Complexity on Security
- Longer and more complex passwords are exponentially harder to crack
- Random characters increase **entropy** (unpredictability)
- Avoiding obvious patterns prevents automated attacks

## 📚 Conclusion
A strong password balances **length**, **complexity**, and **randomness**. Supplement your password strategy with **MFA** and **password managers** for better protection.
